## Introduction

**You need a server installation** to have a web interface and to send notifications.
The server needs PHP and can be installed when a machine has PHP installed.

You also can install it on your local machine or a dedicated system

* using Apache httpd/ Nginx and php or
* using docker

You can check the application status in your network or on shared hosting.
