# Description #

The application monitor is a complementing tool next to the classic system monitoring of servers and its services. It makes checks from the point of view of the application: with its credentials and permissions started on the application hosts.

# Installation / Get started #

Go to page [Server](10_Server/10_Installation.md) to install the server that contains the server and client components.

If you have a server already and want to monitor an PHP application then go to [PHP-Client](30_%F0%9F%93%83_PHP-client/10_Introduction.md).

# Features #

Client data

- define the user groups to notify if the application status changes
- define tags that will be visible in the server ui to filter by a group of application types or departments or other logic
